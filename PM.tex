\section{Project Stages}
	\subsection{Project initiation}
	\textbf{Deadline 2020-11-01}
	Within the initiation phase, the business problem or opportunity is identified, a solution is defined, a project is formed, and a project team is appointed to build and deliver the solution to the customer. A business case is created to define the problem or opportunity in detail and identify a preferred solution for implementation. 
	\subsection{Project planning}
	\textbf{Deadline 2020-12-31}
	The planning phase is when the project plans are documented, the project deliverables and requirements are defined, and the project schedule is created. It involves creating a set of plans to help guide your team through the implementation and closure phases of the project. The plans created during this phase will help us to manage time, cost, quality, changes, risk, and related issues.
	\subsection{Project execution}
	\textbf{Deadline 2021-06-01}
	Is the implementation processes that is the act of doing or performing the works and activities in accordance with agreed plans and procedures to satisfy the specifications and contractual requirements. The Project Execution is the performing the project scope of works and activities in accordance with the project baselines, plans and procedures with the resource, interface, change, schedule, cost, risk, quality, safety and environment management, and other contractual requirements.
	\subsection{Project performance} 
	\textbf{Deadline 2021-06-01}
	Occurring at the same time as the execution phase, this one mostly deals with measuring the project performance and progression in accordance to the project plan. Scope verification and control occur to check and monitor for scope creep, and change of control to track and manage changes to project requirement. Calculating key performance indicators for cost and time are done to measure the degree of variation, if any, and in which case corrective measures are determined and suggested to keep a project on track.
	\subsection{Project closure}
	\textbf{Deadline 2021-07-01}
	Team at this point is terminated. Once a project is complete, Project manager organize meeting to evaluate what went well in a project and identify failures.

		Probability &
		Impact &
		\multicolumn{1}{c|}{Response} \\ \hline
		R1 &
		\textbf{Unfamiliarity with development process used}. Team members unfamiliar with development process will have a slower workflow resulting in longer delivery times&
		Low &
		Medium &
		\textbf{Team will perform a bi-weekly retrospective meeting} at the end of the week. These retrospectives should create a safe space for team members to share their honest feedback on what's going well and what isn't, and to generate a discussion around what could be improved next time regarding the development process during the sprint.		\\ \hline
		R2 &
		\textbf{Inefficiency of the development process}. inefficient development process lead time and lowers deliverable quality.&
		Low&
		High&
		{\textbf{Perform bi-monthly squad health checks} to gather what each team member feels about the following aspects: delivering value, easy to release, health of codebase, mission, speed, suitable process, support and teamwork. Results will allow to make necessary plans on which aspect/s to improve resulting in higher team motivation and synergy as well as adjusting the unfamiliar.\newline \textbf{Collect data of KPIs}, such as, registered defects per day, commits per day, what tasks are assigned to which member, lead time, etc. in order to follow the current state of the development process and see if made changes affected those KPIs}\\ \hline		
		R3 &
		\textbf{Low team motivation, synergy and/or coordination}. Low motivation, synergy and/or coordination results in slower lead time, lack of innovation and is prone to higher no. of errors during the execution of the project &

		Medium&
		High&
		Perform a different tech analysis in order to gauge the difficulty to master said tech, it's ease of use, functionality, how comfortable is the team to use said tech and so on. Performed analysis will let to pick the tech that is not only suited, but is also familliar to the team members.
		Organise knowledge sharings/workshops at the begining of the project in order for the team to fammiliarize themselves to the tech-stack\\ \hline
